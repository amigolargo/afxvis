## visualising Soundcloud user19081971


In early 2015, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin" target="_blank">Aphex Twin</a> began uploading rare and unreleased music to an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user18081971" target="_blank">anonymous Soundcloud account</a>. By late October he had uploaded 261 tracks, and a <a href="http://user18081971.watmm.com/" target="_blank">fan voting site</a> had appeared to help Aphex Twin himself decide which tracks should get remastered and released traditionally. Plotting fan votes against Soundcloud plays gives us a new visual means to explore the archive.
